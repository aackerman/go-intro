            I'm Aaron Ackerman, I've been with Code42 for about three months. I'm a developer on the Ruby team working on Office42 and other internal apps. We're going to be talking about Go today. Now, I haven't been working with Go for very long so I might not be able to answer all of your questions, and if you know anything about Go I'm going to gloss over a few things.

          <h2>What is it?</h2>
          <p>Go is a programming language</p>
          <p>Started by Rob Pike and Ken Thompson</p>
          <p class="fragment">Ever heard of UTF-8? Those guys wrote it</p>
          <p class="fragment">Ken Thompson designed and implemented the original Unix</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            After decades of experience in software they decided to design a modern language to to handle some of the modern challenges of software engineering.

          <h2>Why is it?<br/>What is Go trying to accomplish?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Faster iteration, faster software development</li>
            <li class="fragment">Easy dependency management</li>
            <li class="fragment">Should feel dynamic even though statically typed</li>
            <li class="fragment">Built in garbage collection and concurrency</li>
            <li class="fragment">Meant to replace C++ at Google</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            So why does Go exist, why not just use C, C++, or Java.

            Well what do we want for modern software development? We want to be agile, to write code fast and react to changes.

            *slide*
            We want easy dependency management.

            *slide*
            We want it to be very dynamic,

            *slide*
            have automatic garbage collection and concurrency.

            *slide*
            Go was meant to replace C++ as the main language of use at Google.

            Go was open sourced in 2009 and hit one oh in March last year.

            *slide*
            Go 1 promised no backwards-incompatible changes.
            So all of APIs you write for in 1.0 will be available until 2.0.

            *slide*
            A stong standard library. All of the standard library is written in Go. It's not written in C, so the standard libraries are great examples of Go code.

            A few quick things about the standard library, built-in file archiving and compression, built-in crypto. Go file AST, parser, tokenizer and scanner in the STD lib. So in the standard library tools are already included for analyzing your Go source code.
            And, really easy command line flag parsing.

            *slide*
            Go has great documentation on golang.org and a lot of use and contribution to the mailing list.

            *slide*
            And at Google, Go is running dl.google.com for all Chrome downloads.

            If you have fifteen seconds you can download a binary for your system. Mac has a standard package, and the same for Linux and Windows, or you can build from source. No more time spent building a binary, you get the binary and you build great software. The only language I've seen that was this easy to install is Node.

            <h2>GOPATH</h2>
            <p>Your GOPATH is where all of your Go source lives</p>
            <pre><code>.
├── bin
├── pkg
└── src
    ├── package1
    ├── package2
    └── package3</code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              Your gopath has a is used to resolve imports and holds all of your source code and compiled binaries. You have bin, package, and src. Src holds your real source code, package holds installed package objects, and bin has your binaries. That's another thing that I haven't mentioned yet. To compile a package you would type `go install package-name`, it looks up your gopath in your source directory and looks for a package name. And when you install a package you get a single binary. So that means you don't even need to install a Go runtime on a machine that needs to run Go. Sounds easy right, single binary distribution, code doesn't need to be loaded into a VM, how can it be easier.

            <h2>Gofmt yourself</h2>
            <pre><code>$ go fmt file.go</code></pre>
            <p>Forget about formatting your code.<br/>The computer will do it for you.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              I know the Java team has a tool for automatically formatting code. Go has `gofmt`, it takes a go source file and gives you back idiomatically formatted Go source code. All of the standard library has been run through `gofmt`. No more commits containing semantic formatting changes, no more arguments about newlines and spacing the decision has been made for you.

<pre><code>package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            So a few basic things. Specify a package, import the "fmt" library for string formatting and we have a main function as the entrance function. Just a standard print line standard out.

    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
  })
  http.ListenAndServe(":8000", nil)
}
</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            This is more of a hello world in my opinion, some that actually requires a network connection. We import net http and we get access to the standard http library. So there's a little bit of magic under the covers here, http.HandleFunc and http.ListenAndServe both attach to a Default Serve Mux which is an http multiplexer. This let's us get away with such a small server.

            <h2>semi-colons<br/> only when absolutely necessary</h2>

func main() {
  http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
  })
  http.ListenAndServe(":8000", nil)
}
</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            semi-colons are the line-terminator for Go but in most places they can be omitted, so I tend to just omit them until the compiler complains there are strict rules

            <h2>short assignment</h2>
<pre><code>i := 64
f := 3.14
str := "hello, world!"</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            We can use the short assignment operator the colon equals and we don't need to be explicit about a type and the compiler will infer the type at compile time.
          </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>only one loop</h2>
<pre><code>for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
  // basic iteration
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>for k, v = range hashmap {
  // iterate over a range
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>for {
  // a while loop
}</code></pre>
          <p>Also, parens only when necessary</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            So there's only one loop in Go, no while loops no do while loops no each loops, it's all just for loops. But for loops can be formatted as a normal C style for loop with an initialize, a comparison bool and a statement that runs before the loop. We get an each style loop that can loop over structs, arrays and slices, and a for loop without extra information that is essentially a while loop.

uint32      all unsigned 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295)

float32     all IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point numbers
float64     all IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers
complex64   all complex numbers, float32 real and imaginary
complex128  all complex numbers, float64 real and imaginary
byte        alias for uint8
rune        alias for int32</code></pre>
          <p>also</p>
<pre><code>uint     either 32 or 64 bits
int      same size as uint
uintptr</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            We get really clear numeric types, we don't have C-style signed and unsigned separate keywords we don't have shorts, longs and doubles, the types describe themselves clearly. Other types in Go include Arrays, Slices, Strings, Structs, Pointers, Functions, Interfaces, Maps and Channels. I don't have time to talk about all of them.

            <h2>multiple return values</h2>
<pre><code>ok, err := possibleErrorMethod()
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
  return err
}
</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            This is one of my favorite features of Go, multiple return values. You get a sort of destructuring you can find in other languages, but this is really useful for getting back a possible positive result but easily checking if there was an error and escaping.

          <section>
            <h2>fallthrough</h2>
            <p>Breaks are implicit, fallthrough explicitly</p>
<pre><code>i := 3
switch i {
  case i > 1:
    fmt.PrintLn("greater than 1")
    fallthrough
  case i > 2:
    fmt.PrintLn("greater than 2")
    fallthrough
  case i == 3:
    fmt.PrintLn("exactly 3")
}</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            Fallthrough is something that I've always wanted. Why do we have all these breaks everywhere? We should just explicitly fallthrough instead of explicitly break.

          <aside class="notes">
            We can use the blank identifier if we want to throw away values and not assign them to a variable. This is really useful in the case where you're looping over an array and only care about the values and not the indexes.

  go even()
  odd()

          <aside class="notes">
            Alright who wants to take a quick guess at what this function is going to do? (Wait for answer).
            The go operator starts a funtion in a goroutine, which can be thought of as a lightweight thread. Now when I say lightweight I mean really light weight. One of the main implementors Rob Pike stated that at google there were some processes that had upwards of a million goroutines running in one process. So let's run the code and check it out.

            We can see that both the odd and even functions are running at the same time but based on the number only one of them is going to print to standard out. There are specific constucts in Go for passing messages between goroutines and those are called channels but they are complicated to wrap your head around in just a few minutes so I've decided to leave them out of this talk.

<pre><code>file, err := os.Open("file.go")
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
  return err
}
defer file.Close()

// other code

return retval
</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            Files need to be closed, and it's easy to forget to close a file at the end of a function. What if there was a language construct that handled this for you. I specify to defer closing the file. This effectively runs all deferred actions just before the return value. That's awesome, and it keeps file opening and file closing very close to each other.

  Name string              `json:"name"`
  FavoriteAnimal string    `json:"animal"`
}</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            JSON is everywhere, and it should be easy to convert object to exactly the JSON that we're looking for. This construct allows us to do this in a ridiculously simple manner. No separate functions that need to be called to transform keys. Whenever you use JSON.marshal on an object of this type the fields will be formatted as specified in the struct.
          </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>struct methods</h2>

            <p>Go doesn't have <i>this</i> or <i>self</i>, Go has an explicit receiver</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              This is the method signature employed by a File object, it's a function called on a pointer to a file, the method is a public Write method that accepts a slice of bytes, and has two return values, an int for the number of bytes written to the file and an error that will be returned as nil if the write was successful.

          <small>plus closures and currying</small>
          <aside class="notes">
            First class functions are probably the most powerful thing about JavaScript a highly dynamic language. And they also exist in Go a statically typed language. First-class functions give us a lot of flexbility. Let's talk about what this code is doing. We have an adder function that takes an int and returns a function that accepts an int and returns an int. We can use this functionality to dynamically write methods. In this trivial example I create a method that adds five to another integer input.
